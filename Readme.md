** Simultaneous charging stations' location and UAV path planning **

UAVs are increasingly used for diverse delivery services, including disaster relief, medical supplies, and online orders. With the potential for autonomous drones operating in civil airspaces for such services, efficient placement of recharging stations becomes crucial for enabling multi-hop operations within limited range. Thus facility location of recharging stations and path optimization (FLPO) of the drones through these stations to their specific destination coordinates becomes a crucial problem.
This work is an application of a stagewise framework for facility location and path optimization framework based on the MEP to place recharging stations for a fleet of drones moving within an operational area.
