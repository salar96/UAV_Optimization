## Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed for a variety of delivery services, encompassing disaster relief efforts, medical supply distribution, and fulfilling online orders. The advent of autonomous drones operating in civil airspaces highlights the importance of efficient management strategies for these services. Central to the operational efficiency of UAVs is the strategic placement of recharging stations and the optimization of flight paths through these stations to designated destinations. This research introduces a comprehensive stagewise framework that employs the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) for the Facility Location and Path Optimization (FLPO) of drones. Our methodology addresses the critical challenge of ensuring continuous operations within the operational constraints of UAVs, thereby facilitating multi-hop missions across extensive areas.
